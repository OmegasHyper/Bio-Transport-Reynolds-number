# üî¨ Reynolds Number Flow Analysis (Biotransport SBEG201)

This repository contains the computational analysis of the **Reynolds Number ($\mathbf{Re}$)** and its role in classifying fluid flow into Laminar, Transitional, and Turbulent regimes. The project uses advanced software integration to fulfill analytical and visualization requirements.

## üéØ Project Highlights & Core Achievements

1.  **Analytical Modeling:** Calculated $\mathbf{Re}$ for a comprehensive matrix of configurations, including critical biofluids (Blood, CSF), demonstrating the transition from viscous to inertial dominance.
2.  **Advanced Architecture:** Implemented a **hybrid Node.js/MATLAB system** for the interactive calculator, separating the front-end user experience from the core analytical engine.
3.  **CFD Simulation (Bonus):** Applied **OpenFOAM** to model high-$\mathbf{Re}$ turbulent flow (Lid-Driven Cavity), visualizing complex momentum transfer patterns.

## ‚ú® Key Visual Results

### 1. Hybrid Calculator Verification
The application provides instant, color-coded regime classification.

### 2. Profile Transformation
Visualization shows the fundamental shift from the **Parabolic** profile (Laminar, $\mathbf{V_{\text{max}} = 2 V_{\text{avg}}}$) to the **Blunt** turbulent profile.

### 3. Frictional Resistance Analysis
The logarithmic plot confirms the energy loss shift: steep decline in the laminar regime ($\mathbf{f \propto 1/Re}$) versus a shallow decline in the turbulent regime ($\mathbf{f \propto 1/Re^{0.25}}$).
